# Chrono Time Manager

A modern and elegant time management application featuring a stopwatch and train timer functionality.

## Features

### Stopwatch
- High-precision timing with millisecond accuracy
- Start, pause, and reset functionality
- Lap time recording with difference indicators
- Visual color-coded time display (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Clean and intuitive interface

### Train Timer
**-Multiple time train management:**
Use Case: Managing different exercises or stations in a workout. For example, in a circuit training session, each station (e.g., push-ups, squats, planks) can have its own timer.
Benefit: Allows users to structure and organize complex workout routines with varying durations for each component.

**-Customizable coach timers:**
Use Case: Setting specific durations for coaching or rest periods between exercises. A coach might allocate different times for instruction, execution, and recovery.
Benefit: Provides flexibility to tailor training sessions to individual needs or specific training protocols (e.g., HIIT, Tabata).

**-Quick time selection (5min, 10min, 15min, 30min):**
Use Case: Quickly setting common training durations without manually inputting the time. Useful for standard exercises or drills that follow typical time intervals.
Benefit: Simplifies the setup process, making it faster and more convenient to start a training session.

**-Loop functionality for continuous operation:**
Use Case: Running a training session in a continuous loop, repeating the same sequence of exercises or drills multiple times. Useful for endurance training or repetitive skill practice.
Benefit: Enables hands-free operation, allowing users to focus on their workout without constantly resetting the timer.

**-Visual indicators for active and completed coaches:**
Use Case: Providing clear visual feedback on the current status of each coach or exercise segment. This could involve color-coding (e.g., green for active, red for completed) or other visual cues.
Benefit: Enhances user awareness and reduces the need to constantly check the timer, improving focus and efficiency during training.
